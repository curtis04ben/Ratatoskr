# Ratatoskr clients

Kotlin Multiplatform + Compose Multiplatform. `shared/` holds the API
client, models and every screen; `desktop/` is the desktop entry point and
packaging; `android/` is the Android app. Architecture and phase plan:
[`docs/development-plan.md`](../docs/development-plan.md).

Needs JDK 21. On Fedora, packaging also needs `java-21-openjdk-jmods`
(jlink can't build the bundled runtime without it); Temurin JDKs include it.

## Three different things

| | What it is | How you get it |
|---|---|---|
| **Development build** | Runs straight from the source tree, using your JDK | `./gradlew :desktop:run` |
| **Packaged app** | AppImage / `.deb` / `.rpm` with its own bundled Java runtime | GitHub Releases, or build locally (below) |
| **Installed app** | The `.rpm`/`.deb` installed: in the app launcher, `ratatoskr` on `PATH` | `sudo dnf install ./ratatoskr-*.rpm` |

Users only ever deal with the last two.

## Tests

```bash
./gradlew :shared:jvmTest
```

`LiveServerTest` only runs when `RATATOSKR_TEST_SERVER` points at a real server.

## Linux packaging

Compose Desktop's `createDistributable` task (jpackage) builds a
self-contained app image: launcher + app jars + a jlinked Java runtime.
`desktop/packaging/linux/build-packages.sh` wraps that one image three ways:

| File | For | Tool |
|---|---|---|
| `Ratatoskr-x86_64.AppImage` | any distro, no install | [appimagetool](https://github.com/AppImage/appimagetool) |
| `ratatoskr_<ver>_amd64.deb` | Debian/Ubuntu | [nfpm](https://nfpm.goreleaser.com) |
| `ratatoskr-<ver>-1.x86_64.rpm` | Fedora/RHEL | nfpm |

jpackage can build `.deb`/`.rpm` itself, but its generated `.desktop` file
can't carry the app ID, `StartupWMClass` or AppStream metadata, so we build
the packages from the app image instead.

```bash
./gradlew :desktop:createDistributable
desktop/packaging/linux/build-packages.sh     # needs nfpm + appimagetool on PATH
ls desktop/build/linux-packages/
```

### Desktop integration

All in `desktop/packaging/linux/`, installed by the `.deb`/`.rpm` (and
embedded in the AppImage):

- **App ID** `io.github.curtis04ben.Ratatoskr` -- the reverse-DNS of the
  GitHub Pages domain the project controls. It names the `.desktop` file,
  the icon and the AppStream metadata. Don't change it once released:
  launchers, pinned favourites and software centres key on it.
- **`.desktop` entry** -> `/usr/share/applications/`. `StartupWMClass`
  must equal the window's X11 `WM_CLASS`, which AWT derives from the main
  class (`com-ratatoskr-desktop-MainKt`). If `mainClass` is renamed, update
  it, or KDE/GNOME will show the running window with a generic icon.
- **Icons** -> `/usr/share/icons/hicolor/{48,128,256,512}/apps/`, from `desktop/icons/`.
- **AppStream** metainfo -> `/usr/share/metainfo/` (Discover/GNOME Software).

Install layout: the app in `/opt/ratatoskr/`, `/usr/bin/ratatoskr` a
symlink to its launcher.

## Versioning and releases

The desktop version lives in one place: `ratatoskrDesktopVersion` in
`gradle.properties`. Gradle's `packageVersion` and the package filenames
all read it.

Releases use their own tags (`linux-vX.Y.Z`), separate from the server, so
each component gets its own GitHub Release with only its own files:

```bash
# 1. bump ratatoskrDesktopVersion in clients/gradle.properties, commit, push
# 2. tag that commit
git tag linux-v0.1.1
git push origin linux-v0.1.1
```

The tag triggers `.github/workflows/linux-client-release.yml`, which runs
the tests, builds all three packages, and publishes them with a
`SHA256SUMS` file as the release "Ratatoskr Linux client v0.1.1". It
refuses to release if the tag doesn't match `ratatoskrDesktopVersion`.
Running the workflow manually from the Actions tab builds the packages as
a workflow artifact without releasing anything.

## Android

`android/` is a thin Android app around the same shared screens. What's
Android-specific:

- **`MainActivity`** -- entry point. Sets `FLAG_SECURE` (no screenshots,
  screen recording or recent-apps preview of the vault) and draws
  edge-to-edge with content padded clear of system bars and the keyboard.
- **`KeystoreSessionStore`** -- remembers the server and session token
  across launches, since Android kills backgrounded apps freely. The token
  is AES-256-GCM encrypted under a non-exportable Android Keystore key;
  the master password is never stored. (`EncryptedSharedPreferences` is
  deprecated, so this uses the Keystore directly.) Excluded from backups.
- **`AndroidFiles`** -- CSV import/export via the system file picker, so
  no storage permission is needed.
- **Manifest** -- `INTERNET` is the only permission. Plain `http://` is
  allowed because home servers usually don't have TLS; the connect screen
  warns when the address isn't `https://`.

App ID `io.github.curtis04ben.ratatoskr` (lowercase by Android
convention). Like the desktop ID, it's permanent once released. Minimum
Android 8.0 (API 26), which is where the Autofill Framework (a Phase 3.x
goal) starts.

### Building and running

Needs the Android SDK (`ANDROID_HOME`, or `sdk.dir` in
`clients/local.properties`, which is git-ignored).

```bash
./gradlew :android:installDebug     # build + install on a connected phone/emulator
./gradlew :android:assembleRelease  # release APK (signed only if the env vars below are set)
```

Debug builds install as `io.github.curtis04ben.ratatoskr.debug`, alongside
a release install rather than replacing it.

### Signing

Android only accepts an update signed with the same key as the installed
app, so the release key is permanent: **if it's lost, every user has to
uninstall and reinstall** (losing their saved server). Back it up somewhere
safe outside this machine.

Create it once, on your own machine (it prompts for a password):

```bash
keytool -genkeypair -v -keystore ~/ratatoskr-release.jks -alias ratatoskr \
    -keyalg RSA -keysize 4096 -validity 36500 -dname "CN=Ratatoskr"
base64 -w0 ~/ratatoskr-release.jks > ~/ratatoskr-release.jks.b64
```

Then add four repository secrets in GitHub (Settings -> Secrets and
variables -> Actions): `RATATOSKR_KEYSTORE_BASE64` (the `.b64` file's
contents), `RATATOSKR_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`, `RATATOSKR_KEY_ALIAS`
(`ratatoskr`), and `RATATOSKR_KEY_PASSWORD` (the same password, since
PKCS12 keystores use one). Delete the `.b64` file afterwards. The keystore
never goes in the repo.

To sign locally, set the same variables, with `RATATOSKR_KEYSTORE_FILE`
pointing at the `.jks` instead of the base64 one.

### Releases

Versioned separately as `ratatoskrAndroidVersion` in `gradle.properties`;
`versionCode` is derived from it (`1.2.3` -> `10203`), so it always
increases. Bump, commit, push, then:

```bash
git tag android-v0.1.1
git push origin android-v0.1.1
```

`.github/workflows/android-client-release.yml` tests, builds and signs the
APK, and publishes `Ratatoskr-<version>.apk` + `SHA256SUMS` as the release
"Ratatoskr Android v0.1.1", with install steps and the signing
certificate's fingerprint in the notes. It won't release unsigned.
